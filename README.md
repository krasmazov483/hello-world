Did you ever hear of the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith Legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side tha he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so poowerfull... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his appentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He coul save other from death, but no himself.
